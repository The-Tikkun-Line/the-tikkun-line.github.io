<h2>{{ site.description | escape }}</h2>
<h2>Our work is grounded in the Hearing Voices approach, Intentional Peer Support, and a transformative justice framework. We are always learning how to bring these values into real life—especially in a world that is messy, unpredictable, and full of imperfect people like us.</h2>
<h2>Our goal is to support people with stigmatized diagnoses—like a majority of our peer team and founder—by providing community-based alternatives to police or state-mandated clinical intervention. We do this to foster healing and reduce the risk of forced institutional involvement.</h2>
