<h2>{{ site.description | escape }}</h2>
<h2>Our work is grounded in the Hearing Voices approach, Intentional Peer Support, and a Transformative Justice framework. We are always learning how to bring these values into real life—especially in a world that is messy, unpredictable, and full of imperfect people like us.</h2>
<h2>Our goal is to support people with highly stigmatized forms of neurodivergence—like many of our peers and our founder—by offering relationship-based, self-directed, non-clinical alternatives rooted in the belief that each person is the expert on themselves. We do this to foster healing, strengthen personal agency, and protect the autonomy of people like us.</h2>
