The Tikkun Line is a peer support project for people who experience extreme or altered states, non-consensus realities, psychosis, or use other words that best describe their own experiences.

We use Hearing Voices & Intentional Peer Support peer models and a Transformative Justice liberatory approach.

Our name comes from "Tikkun Olam", meaning "world repair" in Hebrew; a core principle in Judaism that emphasizes the responsibility to improve the world and make it a more just, equitable, and harmonious place. Our logo is a dove carrying a phone like an olive branch, symbolizing world repair through connection.

We acknowledge the humanity in men, women, transpeople, and gender expansive individuals. At this time, we are focused on providing care for trans individuals, women, and gender expansive people because that is the expertise we have on the team currently. We hope to be able to host a space that is inclusive for all people as we gain knowledge about trauma informed care for men.

	About 75% of our team experiences nonconsensus reality. In medical terms, this might be described as "psychosis," though that term is less favored in the broader disability and mad liberation communities.

	We are a fiscally sponsored project, meaning we are a project that is run independently that has a 501c3 parent that houses our funds, allows us to apply for grants, and allows donations to be tax deductible. Our financial decisions and organizational structure are independent from the parent 501c3 that sponsors us.
<!-- 	<p>We are proudly fiscally sponsored* by AWN (Autistic Women & Nonbinary Network). If you would like to support our work, you can make a one-time or monthly contribution through our donation page. Thank you for your generosity!</p>

	<p><sub>*Note: "Fiscally sponsored" means AWN provides us with their 501c3 status in order for us to apply for grants as well as ensure donations are tax deductible. The Tikkun Line's and AWN's budgets are not related whatsoever.</sub></p>
