The Tikkun Line is a peer support project for people who experience extreme or altered states, non-consensus realities, psychosis, or use other words that best describe their own experiences.

We use Hearing Voices & Intentional Peer Support peer models and a Transformative Justice liberatory approach.

Our name comes from "Tikkun Olam", meaning "world repair" in Hebrew, which is a core principle in Judaism that emphasizes the responsibility to improve the world and make it a more just, equitable, and harmonious place.

We are trans and feminist run, and acknowledge the humanity in men, women, transpeople, and gender expansive individuals.

	About 75% of our team experiences nonconsensus reality. In medical terms, this might be described as "psychosis," though that term is less favored in the broader disability and mad liberation communities.
