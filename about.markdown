The Tikkun Project is a peer support initiative for people who experience extreme or altered states, non-consensus realities, psychosis, or use their own language to describe these ways of being.

Our work is grounded in the Hearing Voices approach, Intentional Peer Support, and a transformative justice framework. We are always learning how to bring these values into real life—especially in a world that is messy, unpredictable, and full of imperfect people like us.

Our name comes from Tikkun Olam, a Hebrew phrase meaning “repair of the world.” To us, recovery means being part of that repair—not just for ourselves, but in our relationships, our communities, and the systems around us. Recovery is ongoing. It’s messy, nonlinear, and tied to justice. We don’t see healing, liberation, or lasting change as one-time events—they’re everyday practices we keep returning to imperfectly.

We affirm the humanity of men, women, trans people, and gender-expansive folks. Right now, our offerings are focused on supporting trans people, women, and gender-expansive individuals, because that’s where our team has the most lived and professional experience. As we grow and deepen our understanding of trauma-informed, anti-oppressive care for men, we hope to create space that truly welcomes everyone.

	About 75% of our team experiences nonconsensus reality. In medical terms, this might be described as "psychosis," though that term is less favored in the broader disability and mad liberation communities. We are based on the land of the Multnomah, Clackamas, Kathlamet, Tualatin Kalapuya, and Molalla people referred to as Multnomah County, OR.

	We are a fiscally sponsored project, meaning we are a project that is run independently that has a 501c3 parent that houses our funds, allows us to apply for grants, and allows donations to be tax deductible. Our financial decisions and organizational structure are independent from the parent 501c3 that sponsors us.
